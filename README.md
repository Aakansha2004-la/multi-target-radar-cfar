#  Multi-Target Radar Simulation Toolkit

This project is a **Python-based simulation toolkit** for **multi-target motion detection and tracking** using radar signal processing techniques. It features:

- **1D FFT and CFAR detection**
- **Range-Doppler map visualization**
- **True target plotting**
- **Kalman filter-based tracking (optional)**
- **Streamlit GUI for interaction**

---

##  Features

- Simulate multiple moving targets (range, velocity)
- Add Gaussian noise and clutter
- Apply **1D CFAR** for Doppler detection
- Visualize:
  - FFT spectrum with CFAR detections
  - Range-Doppler Map with CFAR hits and true targets
- Extensible for **2D CFAR** and **Kalman Tracking**
